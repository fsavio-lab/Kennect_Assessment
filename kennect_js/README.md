# Custom `getElementById` Implementation (Vanilla JS)

This is a simple web project that mimics the behavior of `document.getElementById` without actually using it. The DOM is traversed manually using recursion to find elements by their `id`.

## Features

- No usage of `document.getElementById`
- Pure JavaScript DOM traversal
- Works directly in the browser
- Minimal HTML and JS setup

## Demonstration

- Open index.html in your browser.
- it will provide the sample demonstration of the function

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Recursion
- DOM traversal
- Manual attribute checking
- Avoiding built-in DOM utilities
