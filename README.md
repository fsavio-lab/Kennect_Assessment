# Kennect Assessment

## Task Completed

- **Implementation of `getElementById('<id>')`**

This is a simple web project that mimics the behavior of `document.getElementById` without actually using it. The DOM is traversed manually using recursion to find elements by their `id`.

- **Simple Python HTTP Server with Calendar REST API**

This project provides a lightweight HTTP server in Python that exposes a REST API endpoint to retrieve the current date and time, with optional filters for days, weeks, months, and years additions/subtractions.

- **Kennect GitHub Issues Dashboard**

A React + Vite application to visualize GitHub Issues data for public repositories using charts and tables.
